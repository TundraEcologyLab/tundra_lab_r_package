Description: This package provides a suite of functions to aid
	in the manipulation and curation of the often unconventional
	datasets produced by the Tundra lab. The functions are designed
	to accept asymmetric tabular data by default. Many functions
	provide a mechanism for analysing columns to determine if their
	contents pertain to specific data e.g. Year, Day, Snow_depth. These
	functions are utilised to scan directories in search of specific
	data sets. Other functions provide a basis for initial cleaning
	and reporting of data in a standardised form.
